# loan-installments — feature handoff

Feature id: `loan-installments`
Branch at start: release-1.0-remediation (dirty tree with unrelated R16 amount-parsing work — preserve, do not touch)
Status: PLAN APPROVED; domain-spec AMENDED (AMD-1..4). PAUSED until Release 1.0 accepted + release-1.0-wt merged

## Raw idea (owner, 2026-10-16)
"loan planner (a place that you can add a loan and its characteristics) and an installment
manager/coordinator (whatever you want to call it)"

## Orchestrator pre-check
- No loan/installment/amortization domain in `app/src/main`; only "loan"/"mortgage" category
  keywords in `domain/savings/SmartSavingsEngine.kt` and `AutomatedSavingsRuleEngine.kt`.
- Release 1.0 candidate is frozen (see `release-1.0-assurance-handoff.md`); any app/ change
  invalidates release evidence. Feature work is docs-only until the owner decides timing.

## Artifacts
| Stage | Path | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 1 Brief | docs/features/loan-installments/brief.md | RESHAPED (single allowed pass done; E core, per-installment spending rule, installment-declared expenses, payment-level fixed rate). Further reshape → owner. |
| 2 Critique | docs/features/loan-installments/critique.md | DONE (feature-critic) — verdict RESHAPE |
| 3 Domain rules | docs/features/loan-installments/domain-spec.md | DONE (attempt 2). 31 invariants, 25 acceptance examples, 15 open decisions OD-1..OD-15. Recommends separate InstallmentPlanLifecycleCoordinator (new legal path), new expenses.spendingExclusionReason column + canonical predicate/guard, AUTO_RECORD/CONFIRM modes, Long minor-unit math, additive schema. |
| 4 UX flows | docs/features/loan-installments/ux-flows.md | DONE (ux-flow-designer, written without domain-spec). 15 domain-dependent points DD-1..DD-15, 17 OQs; §4.7 provisional state table needs reconciling with domain-spec. Notable: no standalone expense detail screen (declare via Transactions row overflow sheet); Add expense has no currency picker (USD new-expense plans, OQ-7); no app-wide hide-amounts mode (OQ-14). |
| 4b UX reconcile | docs/features/loan-installments/ux-flows.md | DONE. 9 DDs resolved by spec, 4 mapped to ODs (DD-1→OD-3, DD-3→OD-5, DD-4→OD-1, DD-11→OD-9), 2 spec gaps (OQ-18, OQ-19). |
| Gate 2 sheet | docs/features/loan-installments/gate2-decisions.md | DECIDED 2026-10-16 (see Human decisions) |
| 6 Slice plan | workflows/active/loan-installments-plan.md | DONE (attempt 2; 20 slices S1..S13 incl. S2b, S4a-d, S6a-c, S7a-b, S8a-b, S10a-b, S12a-b; S0 D-1..D-20; 12 plan-gate items; risk register R1-R18). S0 addendum merged. APPROVED 2026-10-16. |
| 5 Impact & tier | docs/features/loan-installments/impact-map.md | DONE (Part A + Part B). Tier T3. DB 151→152 additive; 44 ExpenseDao SUM( + 229 effectiveAmount uses (70 files); new legal path + TLC op; FG-10/11/12/13/14/16/17/21/26 (+02/06/07/23 for new guards); conflicts with release worktree in TransactionsScreen/VM, AddExpenseViewModel, BudgetScreen. |

## Human decisions
- PENDING Gate 1 (go / reshape / drop). Critique verdict RESHAPE: v1 = payment tracking only (fixed amount × N
  payments), no amortization engine; one stated spending rule; explicit reuse-vs-separate criteria; correct brief
  code claims. Reshape needs owner answers (critique Q1–Q7) — the single allowed strategist reshape pass will be
  run WITH those answers, not before.

- 2026-10-16 owner answers (verbatim): "i think e is the closest one and the one that closely corresponds to
  the needs. i think the installment shall count splitted and not at once ( as the user will not pay at once ) .
  thought might be handy to be able an expesne to declare it installments and set number and the ammount to be
  splitted . fixed rate for now is sufficient / yes definitely post 1.0"
  Recorded as Gate 1 = RESHAPE (owner answered the reshape questions; revised brief returns to owner for
  confirmation before stage 3). Interpretation:
  - E (unified installment overview) is the core.
  - Spending recognised per installment, not all at once on purchase day.
  - New capability: declare an expense as installments (number of payments + amount split).
  - Fixed rate only for v1.
  - Post-1.0 confirmed; docs-only until the release candidate is accepted.
  Unanswered: budgets vs cash-flow-only (critique Q3, partly implied by "count splitted"), recurring reuse vs
  separate (Q5, defer to domain-modeler), currency (Q6), personal test case (Q1b), lent/borrowed (C).

- 2026-10-16 owner answers to reshaped-brief open questions (verbatim): "i think euro and dollar is enough for
  now . i have an ongoing loan on me but hopnestly we can mock any data we want so to speak through testing.
  money lent to someone wont be bad to have ( but it doesnt propably have fixed criteria like rate or data ) for
  what happens i am unaware , i guess when you cancel it is shall be cancelled all together ( i need your opinion )
  i think they shall count in the monthly bugdet"
  Interpretation:
  - Q1 currency: EUR + USD in v1 (per-currency totals; no silent cross-currency sum).
  - Q2 test case: mock/golden data in tests (owner has a real loan but mock is fine).
  - Q3 lent money (C): wanted, loosely structured (no fixed rate/schedule). v1 vs later NOT decided — adding to v1
    is scope growth beyond reshaped brief → owner must choose.
  - Q4 cancel/edit: owner leans "cancel all together", asked for opinion → domain-modeler to formalise options
    with a recommendation; owner decides at Gate 2.
  - Budgets: installments count in the monthly budget of the month they fall due (confirms spending rule).
  - Q5 (unconfirmed past installments) and Q6 (per-installment bank notifications): unanswered → domain-modeler
    proposes defaults as open decisions for Gate 2.
  - Reshaped brief itself: not yet explicitly confirmed (GO pending).

- 2026-10-16 owner scope addition (verbatim): "it would be nice to have the ability to see past loans etc so the
  user has an image of what they had even if now is payed . what do you suggest for the lent to someone thing"
  Recorded: owner-requested addition to increment 1 — history of completed / cancelled plans stays viewable
  (owner is the scope authority; added to brief "Owner addenda"). Domain-modeler must check retention/cleanup
  policy interaction. Orchestrator suggestion on lent money (C) given to owner: defer to increment 2 as a separate
  lightweight "money owed" record (not a payment plan, not spending). Awaiting owner decision + GO.

- 2026-10-16 owner: "ok to the lenting and go" → Gate 1 = GO on reshaped brief (incl. plan history);
  lent/borrowed money (C) deferred to increment 2.

- 2026-10-16 owner asked to give agents longer turn budgets. Applied to the 8 untracked feature-pipeline agents
  (.claude/agents): strategist 30→60, critic 25→50, domain-modeler 45→90, ux-flow-designer 35→70,
  impact-mapper 35→80, planner 40→80, implementer 50→80, test-author 45→80. Tracked/shared agents
  (guardians, reviewer-strict, validation-runner, release-*) NOT changed — pending owner OK (shared with the
  Release 1.0 campaign).
- 2026-10-16 owner: "change those also" → maxTurns raised on tracked/shared agents: architecture-, privacy-security-,
  room-migration-guardian, reviewer-strict, release-final-reviewer, release-finding-verifier, release-horizontal-auditor,
  release-vertical-auditor, release-regression-auditor, release-planner, release-remediation-coder, release-test-author
  → 80; validation-runner 35→60. (reviewer-strict had no maxTurns line; added.) Not changed: debugger, scout,
  release-orchestrator, feature-orchestrator. These are uncommitted modifications to tracked files.

- 2026-10-16 GATE 2 owner answer (verbatim): "do the reccomended. i think we can a currency picker . historical i
  guess. shall we have categories for loans or not. there are types of but i dont know if they matter to be
  categorized (naming them can be enough ) make installments visible yes. 5 is ok yes . lets leave hiding ammounts
  out for now"
  Recorded:
  - OD-1..OD-15: ACCEPT agent recommendations (OD-15 only if planner proves necessary).
  - IM-1..IM-10: APPROVED (schema 151→152 additive; T3 + guardians + reviewer-strict; LEGAL_PATHS update; 3 new
    guards; db_ownership_policy entries; raw-money-aggregate allowlist/ratchet change only as needed and itemised;
    IM-7 worker host = planner proposes, owner confirms at plan gate; enum values; wipe/backup-privacy verify;
    build after Release 1.0 work lands).
  - OQ-7: ADD a currency picker in Add expense (scope to be kept minimal by planner; general vs installment-only
    flagged for plan gate).
  - OQ-18: payments made before using the app → history only (no expenses created, do not count).
  - OQ-19: no loan "type" taxonomy — plan name is enough. Installment expenses still need a spending category for
    budgets/analytics: purchase-attached plans inherit the purchase category; standalone plans → user picks an
    existing category with a sensible default (planner to choose from existing categories).
  - OQ-22: auto-recorded installment expenses visibly marked: YES.
  - OQ-16: declare from Transactions row menu: OK.
  - OQ-14: hide-amounts mode: OUT of scope.
  - OQ-23 = OD-13: no event table in v1 (recommendation accepted).
  - OQ-8/10/11/17 unanswered, low-risk → planner defaults (per-currency history header, Spanish parity with
    existing values-es, Home link optional, no lent-money teaser), listed for plan gate.

- S0 discovery persisted: docs/features/loan-installments/discovery-s0.md (scout). Key: no recurring
  materialise worker → AUTO_RECORD needs a NEW worker; no erase-all path found; rescue allow-list must add plan tables;
  ExportAnonymizer is per-table explicit (and does not sanitise expenses — out-of-scope observation); no 150→151
  migration test (pre-existing gap); no Loans category (new default would need back-fill); Add expense has no currency
  choice, reusable picker is private in ReceiptScanScreen; cloud-briefing entry point = UpcomingItem sealed type.

- 2026-10-16 PLAN GATE owner answer (verbatim): "i approve the reccomendations yes" → plan APPROVED with all
  planner recommendations:
  1 dedicated InstallmentDueRecordingWorker (no reusable worker exists); 2 currency picker option A
  (installment-scoped); 3 OQ-18 = PAID_BEFORE_TRACKING entry status (spec amendment before S5); 4 OQ-24 financing
  cost excludes SKIPPED/CANCELLED/REVERSED (spec §9 amendment); 5 standalone plans: no preselected category (no
  Loans category exists; no new category created); 6 guard designs as proposed (in-source exemption marker, cloud
  guard new-or-extend per D-20, raw-money-aggregate re-key only — any growth = STOP); 7 pre-existing raw-.amount
  sums: decide when D-11 list exists (deferred decision); 8 defaults OQ-8/10/11/17/20/21/25 + hidden entry until
  S13; 9 no index on spendingExclusionReason; 12 instrumented migration proof on emulator (e.g. wave5-api35) —
  never PASS without a real run. Items 10/11 conditional (ask if triggered).
  Out-of-scope observations (no 150→151 migration test; ExportAnonymizer not sanitising expenses; Bills→Food
  mapping) reported to owner; no action requested.

- 2026-10-16 domain-spec amended by domain-modeler: AMD-1 PAID_BEFORE_TRACKING (INV-32), AMD-2 financing cost
  formula, AMD-3 plan category source (INV-33), AMD-4 OD-1..OD-15 decided. Amended INV-6/15/17/20/21/26; new
  AE-26..AE-30; 33 invariants total; no DDL change. Flagged to owner (no decision requested unless they object):
  declaring an already-captured purchase with k>0 paid-before-tracking makes those past months count 0 (user can
  instead use "Record all past payments" to count them).

## Slice statuses
- none (no plan yet)

## Validation run IDs
- none

## Open risks
- 2026-10-16 ~10:00: the uncommitted R16 amount-parsing edits disappeared from this worktree; verified they were
  MOVED to the release worktree `C:/Users/panos/Desktop/Cost-agregator-release` (branch `release-1.0-wt`) by other
  release work, which is actively editing AddExpenseViewModel, TransactionsScreen/ViewModel, BudgetScreen,
  ManualRecurringExpenseScreen, AmountUtils, AmountInputSanitizer, etc. → future merge-conflict risk with this feature.
  This worktree's tree is clean apart from the untracked feature docs and .claude/agents files.
- Domain-spec flags (outside this feature): BackupVerifier.kt:522 would fail on any non-RECURRING_RULE occurrence row;
  recurring event metadata reaching export unverified; AmountUtils/AmountInputSanitizer half-up rounding to confirm
  (do not modify under this feature without approval).
- Timing vs. Release 1.0 freeze.
- Money/currency/rounding (amortization math) → likely T3.

## Next action
Owner answers plan-gate items 1-12 (workflows/active/loan-installments-plan.md "Human decisions required" + S0
addendum). Then: if OQ-18 = PAID_BEFORE_TRACKING and/or OQ-24 confirmed → domain-modeler amends domain-spec
(§3.2, INV-6, §9, §11.1, new AEs) BEFORE S5. Implementation (S1 onward) starts only after Release 1.0 is accepted
and release-1.0-wt is merged; branch from bug-fixes; S11/S12a/S12b hard-gated on that merge. Docs-only until then.

## Cross-feature risk (recorded by orchestrator 2026-10-16, from manual-entry-currency domain-spec OD-4 / RF-3)
- TransactionLifecycleCoordinator never refuses an UNFLAGGED save when no exchange rate exists (it saves with default base values).
  So this plan's S11 "FX unavailable → keep form" refusal (D-8) and the AUTO_RECORD_DEFERRED_FX branch cannot trigger as designed.
  Resolution (DECIDED at manual-entry-currency Gate 2, G2-6): land manual-entry-currency's core slice (eligibility rule +
  request flag + typed refusal, no UI) BEFORE loan S11, and have declareWithNewExpense set the flag. Also: loan S11's EUR/USD control
  will be merged into the general currency control (manual-entry-currency N2, owner-approved). Re-check S11 at its S0.

## Approved global post-1.0 build order (manual-entry-currency Gate 2 G2-1, 2026-10-16)
Release 1.0 (incl. R16, R23 part 1) → ai-fixes → money-correctness-1.0.x (if specced; else after MEC a) → MEC core (a, setter-less)
→ loan S1..S10 (S3/S6a serialised vs TLC work) → nl-quick-add inc 1 → MEC (b) add-expense UI → MEC (c) receipt review
→ loan S11 on the general currency control (plan edits at loan S0: S11 write set, D-8, S6a AUTO_RECORD_DEFERRED_FX) → nl-quick-add inc 1b → MEC inc 1b.

## manual-entry-currency convergence (MEC plan slice D, 2026-10-16; pre-approved by MEC Gate 2 G2-6 (+G2-1, G2-10, G2-15); loan-plan edits applied by the loan planner at loan S0; reviewer-strict ACCEPT-WITH-NOTES, reference fixes applied)
Source: workflows/active/manual-entry-currency-plan.md §D; docs/features/manual-entry-currency/domain-spec.md (INV-5, INV-18, AE-28, AE-29, RF-3).
1. **S11:** remove the EUR/USD segmented control (loan plan :455), the plan-currency row and the OD-14 note (loan ux-flows.md:222-224; currency option table loan plan :517);
   also obsolete under items 1–2: FX test :462, "currency-scope decision" :464, option-B stop-and-ask :467. Use MEC slice B2's general currency control in
   `mode = INSTALLMENT` (options ∩ {EUR, USD}; unsupported selection → Unset, restored when installments are switched off — MEC UX-Q-6).
   S11 depends on MEC B2 (and C, per the global order). S11's "FX unavailable" copy is replaced by the shared `mec_` copy.
2. **D-8 answered:** TLC refuses only FLAGGED creates. `declareWithNewExpense` sets
   `userPresentRate = UserPresentRateRequirement(entryZone)` on the purchase request. On `ValidationFailed.rateRefusal` the plan coordinator
   returns its typed refusal before inserting the plan → the whole declaration aborts (MEC INV-18).
3. **S7a / RF-3:** (the branch and `recordDueEntries` live in loan **S7a**, plan :351; R15 :591) `AUTO_RECORD_DEFERRED_FX` assumes a refusal that never happens for unflagged creates. Auto-record never sets the flag and is
   created with today's defaults (MEC AE-29). Recommendation: drop the FX deferral branch; any loan-local deferral must call
   `RateEligibilityEvaluator`, never re-implement the rule. Re-assess loan risk R15.
4. Recommendation: set the flag already in **S6a** (before S11) inside `declareWithNewExpense` (no production caller before S11; INV-18 testable
   at coordinator level). `recordDueEntries` (S7a) must never set it — the AE-29 null-flag test belongs in **S7a**.
5. Serialise AFTER MEC A2: loan **S3** (TLC + ExpenseDao + exhaustive `when (request.source)` :508-526 via `ExpenseSource.INSTALLMENT_PLAN`,
   plan :192) and **S6a** (consumes A2's `userPresentRate`/`rateRefusal` contract).
6. MEC A2's setter allow-list guard (`ManualEntryCurrencySetterAllowListGuardTest`) already pins
   `domain/installment/lifecycle/InstallmentPlanLifecycleCoordinator.kt`. A rename needs owner approval (MEC N16). The guard is file-level, so
   "declare only, never auto-record" is enforced by the AE-29 test + reviewer-strict.
7. Loan UX doc follow-up for MEC UX-Q-6 (plan-currency row removed; installment-mode currency subset).
Questions for the loan planner (reviewer, not defects): (a) any kept loan-local deferral contradicts AE-29 ("never refused by this rule") and
the evaluator needs an entry zone a background run doesn't have → drop the branch by default; any kept deferral goes to the owner.
(b) `declareWithNewExpense` runs TLC inside `runWrite { withTransaction { … } }` (plan :286) while MEC G2-12 says refusal events commit with no row
→ the S6a AE-28/INV-18 test must pin whether the outer transaction commits or rolls back TLC's two refusal events.
Note: loan S0 discovery already exists (plan :4, discovery-s0.md) — re-run S0 after 1.0 before applying these edits.
Acknowledge at loan S0; loan plan edits made by the loan planner under G2-6.
